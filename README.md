# Univariate-Time-Series-Selection

In this notebook I explain the process I follow to choose a univariate time series regression model, in this case a special case of [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) with seasonal effects. The purpose of the notebook is educational, so the models shown are not necessarily the best one could get with this method. The value of the notebook resides rather on the process it follows to get to a model.
